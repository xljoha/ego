<p>
I have a masters degree in systems science and I am currently part of a 10 person team working according to SCRUM/Agile at the Gothenburg University Library. I have been there for 9 years and have experience working closely with product owners and UX-experts to achieve high quality digital products that are fully responsive and easy to maintain and deploy. 

<p>The tools I have been using heavily are Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Bootstrap, Ember.js, Node, PHP, Drupal 7, Ruby on Rails, HTML 5, LESS, CSS, GIT, GitHub, Docker, Trello and Jira. 

<p>I also have experience working for a large full service web agency called LBi (formerly known as Framfab) where I worked as a frontend developer. I mostly worked with Volvo Cars and Volvo AB. 

<p>I live in Majorna with my girlfriend and our 7-year old dog. My interests are photography, hiking, reading and traveling. I also spend time in our cabin in the  north of Dalsland.
